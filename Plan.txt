high-level structure:

Core Components Needed:


Main program file (pipex.c)
Utilities file(s) for helper functions (utils.c)
Header file (pipex.h)
Libft integration




how we'll structure our implementation:

Create a pipe using pipe(int fd[2]):

fd[0] is the read end
fd[1] is the write end


Fork to create a child process for cmd1:

Child:

Redirect stdin to infile using dup2()
Redirect stdout to pipe write end using dup2()
Execute cmd1 using execve()


Parent:

Fork again for cmd2




Fork to create a child process for cmd2:

Child:

Redirect stdin to pipe read end using dup2()
Redirect stdout to outfile using dup2()
Execute cmd2 using execve()


Parent:

Wait for both children to complete







Key Functions Required:

pipex.c (main program):
- main() - Entry point, argument handling
- pipex() - Core pipe execution logic
- execute_cmd() - Command execution handler

utils.c:
- path finding functions
- string/command parsing functions
- error handling functions



Basic Program Flow:

1. Input validation
   - Check correct number of arguments
   - Validate input/output files
   - Parse commands

2. Pipeline setup
   - Create pipe
   - Fork processes
   - Setup file descriptors

3. Command execution
   - Find command paths
   - Execute commands with proper redirection
   - Handle errors

4. Cleanup
   - Close file descriptors
   - Free allocated memory
   - Wait for child processes




high-level pseudocode structure:

// pipex.h

typedef struct s_pipex {
    int     infile;      // File descriptor for input file
    int     outfile;     // File descriptor for output file
    int     pipe[2];     // Array to hold pipe file descriptors
    char    *cmd1_path;  // Full path to first command
    char    *cmd2_path;  // Full path to second command
    char    **cmd1_args; // Array of arguments for cmd1
    char    **cmd2_args; // Array of arguments for cmd2
    char    **env;       // Copy of environment variables
} t_pipex;

t_pipex pipex; creates a variable named pipex of type t_pipex

envp: a pointer to an array of strings. Each string is of format "NAME=VALUE". For example:
envp = {
    "PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin",
    "HOME=/home/user",
    "USER=username",
    ...
    NULL  // Always NULL terminated
}
The PATH variable is especially important because it tells us where to look for command executables.





// pipex.c

int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
{
    t_pipex	pipex;

    // Validate arguments
    if (argc != 5)
        return (error_handler("Invalid number of arguments"));

    // Initialize pipex struct
    init_pipex(&pipex, argv, envp);

    // Execute pipeline
    execute_pipeline(&pipex);

    // Cleanup
    cleanup_pipex(&pipex);

    return (0);
}


void execute_pipeline(t_pipex *pipex)
{
    // Create pipe
    if (pipe(pipex->pipe) < 0)
        exit_error("Pipe creation failed");

    // First child process (cmd1)
    pid1 = fork();
    if (pid1 == 0)
        execute_cmd1(pipex);

    // Second child process (cmd2)
    pid2 = fork();
    if (pid2 == 0)
        execute_cmd2(pipex);

    // Parent process
    wait_children();
}




more detailed explanation of program flow & stages:



Program Initiation & Validation

int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
{
    t_pipex pipex;

    if (argc != 5)
        return (error_handler("Invalid number of arguments"));

Program is called with format: ./pipex infile cmd1 cmd2 outfile
Must verify we have exactly 5 arguments (program name + 4 required args)
envp contains environment variables including PATH which we'll need for command execution




Initialization

init_pipex(&pipex, argv, envp);

Setup the pipex struct which holds all our program state
Opens input and output files
Parses commands into arguments
Determines command paths by searching in PATH directories
Structure keeps everything organized and accessible




Pipeline Execution

void execute_pipeline(t_pipex *pipex)
{
    if (pipe(pipex->pipe) < 0)
        exit_error("Pipe creation failed");
Creates the pipe which has:

pipe[0] - read end
pipe[1] - write end

This pipe connects our two commands where:

cmd1's output goes into pipe[1]
cmd2 reads from pipe[0]




Process Creation & Command Execution

// First child process (cmd1)
pid1 = fork();
if (pid1 == 0)
    execute_cmd1(pipex);

// Second child process (cmd2)
pid2 = fork();
if (pid2 == 0)
    execute_cmd2(pipex);

The execution creates a pipeline like this:
infile -> cmd1 -> pipe -> cmd2 -> outfile


For cmd1:

Reads from infile (redirects infile to stdin)
Writes to pipe[1] (redirects pipe[1] to stdout)
Executes first command


For cmd2:

Reads from pipe[0] (redirects pipe[0] to stdin)
Writes to outfile (redirects outfile to stdout)
Executes second command





Parent Process & Cleanup

wait_children();
cleanup_pipex(&pipex);

Parent process waits for both child processes to complete
Closes all file descriptors
Frees allocated memory
Handles any errors that occurred



Key Concepts:

Each command runs in its own process
The pipe connects these processes
File descriptors are redirected to create the pipeline
Everything needs proper cleanup to avoid leaks
Error handling throughout all stages

The end result mimics the shell command:
< infile cmd1 | cmd2 > outfile




INCREMENTAL BUILDING-UP OF IMPLEMENTATION:


Phase 1 was:

Basic structure for redirecting I/O
Main pipeline setup with pipe() and fork()
Child and parent process handlers



Phase 2: Command Execution Infrastructure

// command_execute.c

char *find_command_path(char *cmd, char **envp)
{
    // Parse PATH from envp
    // Try each directory to find command
    // Return full executable path or NULL
}

void execute_command(char *cmd, char **envp)
{
    // Split command into args array
    // Get command path
    // Execute with execve
}


Thought process:

For finding paths:

Extract PATH from environment variables
Split into individual directories
Try each directory until we find an executable
Use access() to verify executability
Properly handle memory for paths/joins



For command execution:

Split command string into argument array
Get full path to executable
Execute with proper error handling
Clean up memory if execution fails




Updated to struct-based approach. Benefits:

Better organization of related data
Easier to pass data between functions
Clearer memory management
More scalable for bonus features (multiple pipes, here_doc)





Next Phase, 3: Command Argument Parsing

// parse.c ??

char **split_command(char *cmd)
{
    // Split "ls -l" into {"ls", "-l", NULL}
    // Handle quoted arguments
    // Handle escape characters
}

void init_commands(t_pipex *pipex, char **argv)
{
    // Parse both commands
    // Store command paths and args in struct
}

Why this phase:

Need proper command parsing before execution
Handles command arguments correctly
Prepares data for execve calls
Centralizes command handling logic


And then:
Phase 4: Error handling & memory management
Phase 5: Bonus features (here_doc, multiple pipes)
