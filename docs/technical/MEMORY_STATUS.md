# Memory Analysis Status

## Current State (v1.0)

### Memory Profile
Current Valgrind analysis shows:
- No definite memory leaks
- No indirect memory leaks
- No possible memory leaks
- "Still reachable" memory present but not impacting functionality

### Process Memory Patterns
```
Parent Process:
- Allocations: ~215
- Frees: ~54
- Memory in use at exit: ~19KB

Child Process 1:
- Allocations: ~219
- Frees: ~17
- Memory in use at exit: ~159KB

Child Process 2:
- Allocations: ~179
- Frees: ~16
- Memory in use at exit: ~133KB
```

### File Descriptor Status
- Parent: 3 std FDs at exit
- Children: 2-3 std FDs at exit
- No leaked file descriptors
- Proper pipe closure verified



## Future Optimizations (v2.0)

### Memory Management
- [ ] Review and optimize allocation/free ratio in child processes
- [ ] Implement explicit cleanup for remaining reachable memory
- [ ] Analyze potential for reduced memory usage in command execution

### Process Handling
- [ ] Optimize resource cleanup in child processes
- [ ] Review file descriptor inheritance patterns
- [ ] Consider implementing more granular error handling

### Documentation
- [ ] Add detailed memory usage documentation
- [ ] Document process cleanup strategy
- [ ] Add comments explaining intentional memory patterns

## Notes
- Current implementation passes all memory leak checks
- Program is evaluation-ready with no critical memory issues
- Future optimizations are for code quality, not bug fixes
